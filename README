Wharf Whacker is a Port knocker that doesn't piss me off, and has the following features
- Doesn't piss me off
- Time based rotating ports
- Individual ports per IP address, this prevents replays
- Portable (See doesn't piss me off)

It is going to have some other features
- IPTables (you know the part that makes it actually work, rather than just display information)
- Maybe changing to allow knocks other than just UDP
- Allow different hashing algorithms based on user overloading

And a few features that I don't like
- Not technically released yet
- Not finished
- Locks up under the "right" conditions




The core code is all located in wharfwhacker.py, inside there you will find two classes that are what you will access most of the time when it comes to using WharfWhacker.
- WharfWhacker
- Whacker

The syntax for each is located in the two files
- wharf.py (the server)
- whacker.py (the client)
