Wharf Whacker is a Port knocker that doesn't piss me off, and has the following features
- Doesn't piss me off
- Time based rotating ports
- Individual ports per IP address, this prevents replays
- Very Portable (See doesn't piss me off)

It is going to have some other features
- IPTables (you know the part that makes it actually work, rather than just display information)
- Maybe changing to allow knocks other than just UDP
- Allow different hashing algorithms based on user overloading

And a few features that I don't like
- Broken ass ugly code that needed a repo (don't judge me)
- Not technically released yet
- Not finished
- Locks up under the "right" conditions
