Wharf Whacker is a Port knocking suite, it was designed to have the following features
- Python library for use in other projects
- Time based rotating ports (SHA512 HMAC)
- Individual ports per IP address, this prevents replays
- Portable (you only need python and iptables installed)

It is going to have some other features
- Two-Factor Authentication.
- Logging

And currently has a few features that I don't like
- Not technically released yet
- Not finished
- It has a default password, which you should change

The core code is all located in wharfwhacker.py, inside there you will find two classes that are what you will access most of the time when it comes to using WharfWhacker.
- WharfWhacker
- Whacker

The syntax for each is located in the two files
- wharf.py (the server)
- whacker.py (the client)

FOR THE LOVE OF GOD CHANGE THE DEFAULT PASSWORD.

How the iptables rules work

First we create two new rule chains
WharfWhacker (This is for accepted ip addresses)
WharfWhacked (This is the banlist)

From there any udp traffic goes through WharfWhacked, unless it is banned it will go to whatever port it is supposed to.
Any tcp traffic that is a protected port is sent to the WharfWhacker chain, where unless the ip-address is accepted it will be dropped.
